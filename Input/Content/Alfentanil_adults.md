### Alfentanil model

Alfentanil is another potent, short-acting synthetic opioid analgesic drug, used for anaesthesia in surgery, which is solely metabolized by CYP3A4, with less than 1% of an alfentanil dose being excreted unchanged in urine after intravenous administration. The model has been build and evaluated in healthy adults and published by Hanke et al. [1] The model applies metabolism by CYP3A4 and glomerular filtration. The alfentanil PBPK model adequately described the pharmacokinetics of alfentanil in adults. Additionally the model has been republished and fully described including evaluation documentation of the adult PBPK model in Github under 'https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Alfentanil-Model/tree/v2.0' [2].
